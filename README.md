# Glow On You SPA(Single Page Application)


Glow On You(Glow) is inspired by "Glow And Grow" from GA. 
GA SEI cohorts share feedback - glow(something ) & grow(something to improve) with each other on our projects.
Glow app allows users to share Glow (more positive messages!) by creating a board with a title/topic(i.e. "J - Graduation Project") that many other users can leave glow messages on.
